  abstract = {{To be or to be found? Some contributions relative to this modern
	variant of Hamlet's question are presented here. They aim at better
	apprehending the differences between the points of view of the physicists
	who consider that present-day quantum measurement theories do reach
	their objective and those who deny they do. It is pointed out that
	these two groups have different interpretations of the verbs to be
	and to have and of the criterion for truth. These differences are
	made explicit. A notion of empirical reality is constructed within
	the representation of which the physicists of the first named group
	can consistently uphold their claim. A detailed way of sharpening
	this definition so as to make empirical reality free of nonlocal
	actions at a distance is also described.}},

  abstract = {{We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary
	quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements --
	cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular,
	we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated,
	sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured
	to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known
	or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed,
	we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology.
	On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling
	problems and search problems that are classically intractable under
	plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists
	a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same
	probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P^\#P=BPP^NP,
	and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level.
	Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation.
	Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical
	simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy.
	For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the "Permanent-of-Gaussians
	Conjecture", which says that it is \#P-hard to approximate the permanent
	of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability
	over A; and the "Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture", which
	says that |Per(A)|\&gt;=sqrt(n!)/poly(n) with high probability over
	A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem
	interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not
	assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to
	develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying
	our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained
	way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.}},

  abstract = {Bohr's principle of complementarity predicts that in a welcher weg
	("which-way") experiment, obtaining fully visible interference pattern
	should lead to the destruction of the path knowledge. Here I report
	a failure for this prediction in an optical interferometry experiment.
	Coherent laser light is passed through a dual pinhole and allowed
	to go through a converging lens, which forms well-resolved images
	of the respective pinholes, providing complete path knowledge. A
	series of thin wires are then placed at previously measured positions
	corresponding to the dark fringes of the interference pattern upstream
	of the lens. No reduction in the resolution and total radiant flux
	of either image is found in direct disagreement with the predictions
	of the principle of complementarity. In this paper, a critique of
	the current measurement theory is offered, and a novel nonperturbative
	technique for ensemble properties is introduced. Also, another version
	of this experiment without an imaging lens is suggested, and some
	of the implications of the violation of complementarity for another
	suggested experiment to investigate the nature of the photon and
	its "empty wave" is briefly discussed.},

	a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near
	a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with
	peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to
	be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin
	liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored
	by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting
	magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting
	pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism
	for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic,
	although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual

	famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Gedankenexperiment . Introducing
	a reasonable Locality Condition, we will then derive Bell's theorem,
	which states: (i) that Local Supplementary Parameters Theories are
	constrained by Bell's Inequalities; (ii) that certain predictions
	of Quantum Mechanics violate Bell's Inequalities, and therefore that
	Quantum Mechanics is incompatible with Local Supplementary Parameters
	Theories. I then point out that a fundamental assumption for this
	conflict is the Locality assumption, and I show that in a more sophisticated
	version of the E.P.R. thought experiment ("timing experiment"), the
	Locality Condition may be considered a consequence of Einstein's
	Causality, preventing faster-than-light interactions. The purpose
	of this first part is to convince the reader that the formalism leading
	to Bell's Inequalities is very general and reasonable. What is surprising
	is that such a reasonable formalism conflicts with Quantum Mechanics.
	In fact, situations exhibiting a conflict are very rare, and Quantum
	Optics is the domain where the most significant tests of this conflict
	have been carried out, as presented in sections 7 to 11.}},

	a measurement in which only local actions are permitted. This result
	implies the existence of separable superoperators that cannot be

	believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a task is
	BosonSampling: obtaining a distribution of n bosons scattered by
	some linear-optical unitary process. Here we test the central premise
	of BosonSampling, experimentally verifying that the amplitudes of
	3-photon scattering processes are given by the permanents of submatrices
	generated from a unitary describing a 6-mode integrated optical circuit.
	We find the protocol to be robust, working even with the unavoidable
	effects of photon loss, non-ideal sources, and imperfect detection.
	Strong evidence against the Extended Church-Turing thesis will come
	from scaling to large numbers of photons, which is a much simpler
	task than building a universal quantum computer.}},

  abstract = {{Quantum networks are composed of quantum nodes that interact coherently
	through quantum channels, and open a broad frontier of scientific
	opportunities1. For example, a quantum network can serve as a 'web'
	for connecting quantum processors for computation2, 3 and communication4,
	or as a 'simulator' allowing investigations of quantum critical phenomena
	arising from interactions among the nodes mediated by the channels5,
	6. The physical realization of quantum networks generically requires
	dynamical systems capable of generating and storing entangled states
	among multiple quantum memories, and efficiently transferring stored
	entanglement into quantum channels for distribution across the network.
	Although such capabilities have been demonstrated for diverse bipartite
	systems7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, entangled states have not been achieved
	for interconnects capable of 'mapping' multipartite entanglement
	stored in quantum memories to quantum channels. Here we demonstrate
	measurement-induced entanglement stored in four atomic memories;
	user-controlled, coherent transfer of the atomic entanglement to
	four photonic channels; and characterization of the full quadripartite
	entanglement using quantum uncertainty relations13, 14, 15, 16. Our
	work therefore constitutes an advance in the distribution of multipartite
	entanglement across quantum networks. We also show that our entanglement
	verification method is suitable for studying the entanglement order
	of condensed-matter systems in thermal equilibrium17, 18.}},

	This is strongly believed to be hard to do on a classical computer,
	and motivates the development of technologies that enable precise
	control of multi-photon interference in large interferometers. Here
	we report multi-photon experiments in a 5-mode integrated interferometer.
	We use novel three-dimensional manufacturing techniques to achieve
	simultaneous control of 25 independent parameters that describe an
	arbitrary interferometer. We characterize the chip using one- and
	two-photon experiments, and confirm the quantum mechanical predictions
	for three-photon interference. Scaled up versions of this setup are
	the most promising way to demonstrate the computational capability
	of quantum systems, and may have applications in high-precision measurements

	a Hilbert space representation of the generalized observables that
	appear in the ESR model. We show here that each proper mixture is
	represented by a family of density operators parametrized by the
	macroscopic properties characterizing the physical system \$\Omega\$
	that is considered and that each improper mixture is represented
	by a single density operator which coincides with the operator that
	represents it in QM. The new representations avoid the problems mentioned
	above and entail some predictions that differ from the predictions
	of QM. One can thus contrive experiments for distinguishing empirically
	proper from improper mixtures, hence for confirming or disproving

	does not coincide with the mathematical representation of mixtures
	provided by QM, while the representation of improper mixtures does.
	This feature of the ESR model entails that some interpretative problems
	raising in QM when dealing with mixtures are avoided. From an empirical
	point of view the predictions of the ESR model depend on some parameters
	which may be such that they are very close to the predictions of
	QM in most cases. But the nonstandard representation of proper mixtures
	allows us to propose the scheme of an experiment that could check
	whether the predictions of QM or the predictions of the ESR model

  abstract = {{The interpretation of mixtures is problematic in quantum mechanics
	(QM) because of nonobjectivity of properties. The ESR model restores
	objectivity reinterpreting quantum probabilities as conditional on
	detection and embodying the mathematical formalism of QM into a broader
	noncontextual (hence local) framework. We have recently provided
	a Hilbert space representation of the generalized observables that
	appear in the ESR model. We show here that each proper mixture is
	represented by a family of density operators parametrized by the
	macroscopic properties characterizing the physical system \\${\O}mega\\$
	that is considered and that each improper mixture is represented
	by a single density operator which coincides with the operator that
	represents it in QM. The new representations avoid the problems mentioned
	above and entail some predictions that differ from the predictions
	of QM. One can thus contrive experiments for distinguishing empirically
	proper from improper mixtures, hence for confirming or disproving
	the ESR model.}},

  abstract = {{A goal of the emerging field of quantum control is to develop methods
	for quantum technologies to function robustly in the presence of
	noise. Central issues are the fundamental limitations on the available
	information about quantum systems and the disturbance they suffer
	in the process of measurement. In the context of a simple quantum
	control scenario--the stabilization of non-orthogonal states of a
	qubit against dephasing--we experimentally explore the use of weak
	measurements in feedback control. We find that, despite the intrinsic
	difficultly of implementing them, weak measurements allow us to control
	the qubit better in practice than is even theoretically possible
	without them. Our work shows that these more general quantum measurements
	can play an important role for feedback control of quantum systems.}},

  abstract = {{Most working scientists hold fast to the concept of 'realism'\^a€''a
	viewpoint according to which an external reality exists independent
	of observation. But quantum physics has shattered some of our cornerstone
	beliefs. According to Bell's theorem, any theory that is based on
	the joint assumption of realism and locality (meaning that local
	events cannot be affected by actions in space-like separated regions)
	is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments with
	entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum predictions,
	thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining realism
	as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction
	of 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory
	and experiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local
	realistic theories is incompatible with experimentally observable
	quantum correlations. In the experiment, we measure previously untested
	correlations between two entangled photons, and show that these correlations

  abstract = {{Semiconductor quantum dots (known as artificial atoms) hold great
	promise for solid-state quantum networks and quantum computers. To
	realize a quantum network, it is crucial to achieve light-matter
	entanglement and coherent quantum-state transfer between light and
	matter. Here we present a robust photon-spin entangling gate with
	high fidelity and high efficiency (up to 50 percent) using a charged
	quantum dot in a double-sided microcavity. This gate is based on
	giant circular birefringence induced by a single electron spin, and
	functions as an optical circular polariser which allows only one
	circularly-polarized component of light to be transmitted depending
	on the electron spin states. We show this gate can be used for single-shot
	quantum non-demolition measurement of a single electron spin, and
	can work as an entanglement filter to make a photon-spin entangler,
	spin entangler and photon entangler as well as a photon-spin quantum
	interface. This work allows us to make all building blocks for solid-state
	quantum networks with single photons and quantum-dot spins.}},

  abstract = {{Gedanken experiments are important conceptual tools in the quest
	to reconcile our classical intuition with quantum mechanics and nowadays

	is the quantum behaviour of the controlling devices in such experiments.
	We propose a framework to analyse quantum-controlled experiments
	and illustrate the implications by discussing a quantum version of
	Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment. The introduction of a quantum-controlled
	device (i.e., quantum beamsplitter) has several consequences. First,
	it implies that we can measure complementary phenomena with a single
	experimental setup, thus pointing to a redefinition of complementarity
	principle. Second, a quantum control allows us to prove there are
	no consistent hidden-variable theories in which "particle" and "wave"
	are realistic properties. Finally, it shows that a photon can have
	a morphing behaviour between "particle" and "wave"; this further
	supports the conclusion that "particle" and "wave" are not realistic
	properties but merely reflect how we 'look' at the photon. The framework
	developed here can be extended to other experiments, particularly

  abstract = {A consequence of the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle is that
	one may not discuss the path or ``trajectory'' that a quantum particle
	takes, because any measurement of position irrevocably disturbs the
	momentum, and vice versa. Using weak measurements, however, it is
	possible to operationally define a set of trajectories for an ensemble
	of quantum particles. We sent single photons emitted by a quantum
	dot through a double-slit interferometer and reconstructed these
	trajectories by performing a weak measurement of the photon momentum,
	postselected according to the result of a strong measurement of photon
	position in a series of planes. The results provide an observationally
	grounded description of the propagation of subensembles of quantum
	particles in a two-slit interferometer.},

	of nature---is famously counterintuitive: it predicts that a particle
	can be in two places at the same time, and that two remote particles
	can be inextricably and instantaneously linked. These predictions
	have been the topic of intense metaphysical debate ever since the
	theory's inception early last century. However, supreme predictive
	power combined with direct experimental observation of some of these
	unusual phenomena leave little doubt as to its fundamental correctness.
	In fact, without quantum mechanics we could not explain the workings
	of a laser, nor indeed how a fridge magnet operates. Over the last
	several decades quantum information science has emerged to seek answers
	to the question: can we gain some advantage by storing, transmitting
	and processing information encoded in systems that exhibit these
	unique quantum properties? Today it is understood that the answer
	is yes. Many research groups around the world are working towards
	one of the most ambitious goals humankind has ever embarked upon:
	a quantum computer that promises to exponentially improve computational
	power for particular tasks. A number of physical systems, spanning
	much of modern physics, are being developed for this task---ranging
	from single particles of light to superconducting circuits---and
	it is not yet clear which, if any, will ultimately prove successful.
	Here we describe the latest developments for each of the leading

	assesses and develops a range of tools that are required for performing
	quantum information processing, particularly in photonic systems.
	I investigate the three degrees of freedom of a single photon\^aits
	polarisation, spatialmomentum and time-frequency distributions. For
	polarisation, I show that using wave plates to implement arbitrary,
	single-qubit rotations is more complicated than is commonly appreciated.
	In the spatial-momentum and time-frequency domains, I develop ways
	to perform tomographic analysis of quantum states, and I report the
	first demonstrations of these techniques. In the time-frequency domain,
	the tomography technique utilises entanglement in the photon polarisation
	as a resource to store and provide access to the time-frequency information.
	In my first two experiments, I use spontaneous parametric down-conversion
	to produce entanglement between pairs of single photons in all three
	degrees of freedom. I demonstrate the first characterisation of entanglement
	in spatial modes and the time-frequency domain, the first quantitative
	measurement of entangled qutrit states, and the highest quality entangled
	states yet measured in both polarisation and spatial modes. I also
	report the first realisation of complete hyperentanglement, and a
	full, black-box tomography of a 36-dimensional two-photon state\^athe
	largest system to be characterised in this way to date. In my final
	experiment, I model and implement a new architecture for a controlled-Z
	gate which is much simpler to align than previous implementations.
	This gate requires only one non-classical interference condition,
	the visibility of which is the main limitation to its performance.
	I show that the gate operates effectively as a means of both creating
	entanglement and discriminating between the four elements in a basis
	of maximally entangled, Bell-type states. Indeed, its observed performance
	as a Bell analyser would be sufficient to build a quantum state teleporter
	which would guarantee that the recipient would be left with a better
	copy of an unknown input state than any eavesdropper. In a series
	of numerical simulations, I investigate some of the practicalities
	that arise when using tomographic reconstruction techniques, including
	how to estimate errors, which measurements to make and what is actually
	the optimal reconstruction. In particular, I show that tomographies
	perform better when based on the results from over-complete sets
	of measurements. Finally, I discuss the important issue of how to
	compare two processes, particularly when trying to assess the quality
	of a measured process by comparing it to some expected ideal. Judging
	possible candidate measures against a set of experimentally and theoretically
	motivated criteria eliminates all but a small number which have particularly

	to produce entanglement between pairs of single photons in all three
	degrees of freedom. I demonstrate the first characterisation of entanglement
	in spatial modes and the time-frequency domain, the first quantitative
	measurement of entangled qutrit states, and the highest quality entangled
	states yet measured in both polarisation and spatial modes. I also
	report the first realisation of complete hyperentanglement, and a
	full, black-box tomography of a 36-dimensional two-photon state\^a€''the
	largest system to be characterised in this way to date. In my final
	experiment, I model and implement a new architecture for a controlled-Z
	gate which is much simpler to align than previous implementations.
	This gate requires only one non-classical interference condition,
	the visibility of which is the main limitation to its performance.
	I show that the gate operates effectively as a means of both creating
	entanglement and discriminating between the four elements in a basis
	of maximally entangled, Bell-type states. Indeed, its observed performance
	as a Bell analyser would be sufficient to build a quantum state teleporter
	which would guarantee that the recipient would be left with a better
	copy of an unknown input state than any eavesdropper. In a series
	of numerical simulations, I investigate some of the practicalities
	that arise when using tomographic reconstruction techniques, including
	how to estimate errors, which measurements to make and what is actually
	the optimal reconstruction. In particular, I show that tomographies
	perform better when based on the results from over-complete sets
	of measurements. Finally, I discuss the important issue of how to
	compare two processes, particularly when trying to assess the quality
	of a measured process by comparing it to some expected ideal. Judging
	possible candidate measures against a set of experimentally and theoretically
	motivated criteria eliminates all but a small number which have particularly
	promising characteristics.}},

  abstract = {{Quantum computation is a subject of much theoretical promise, but
	has not been realized in large scale, despite the discovery of fault-tolerant
	procedures to overcome decoherence. Part of the reason is that the
	theoretically modest requirements still present daunting experimental
	challenges. The goal of this Dissertation is to reduce various resources
	required for robust quantum computation, focusing on quantum error
	correcting codes and solution NMR quantum computation. A variety
	of techniques have been developed, including high rate quantum codes
	for amplitude damping, relaxed criteria for quantum error correction,
	systematic construction of fault-tolerant gates, recipes for quantum
	process tomography, techniques in bulk thermal state computation,
	and efficient decoupling techniques to implement selective coupled
	logic gates. A detailed experimental study of a quantum error correcting
	code in NMR is also presented. The Dissertation clarifies and extends
	results previously reported in <a href="/abs/quant-ph/9610043">quant-ph/9610043</a>,

	used to yield surprisingly high-fidelity reconstruction. For a d-dimensional
	Hilbert space with the initial observable in su(d), the measurement
	record lacks information about a matrix subspace of dimension \^a©¾d-2
	out of the total dimension d2-1. We determine the conditions on U0
	such that the bound is saturated, and show they are achieved by almost
	all pseudorandom unitary matrices. When we further impose the constraint
	that the physical density matrix must be positive, we obtain even
	higher fidelity than that predicted from the missing subspace. With
	prior knowledge that the state is pure, the reconstruction will be
	perfect (in the limit of vanishing noise) and for arbitrary mixed
	states, the fidelity is over 0.96, even for small d, and reaching
	F>0.99 for d>9. We also study the implementation of this protocol
	based on the relationship between random matrices and quantum chaos.
	We show that the Floquet operator of the quantum kicked top provides
	a means of generating the required type of measurement record, with
	implications on the relationship between quantum chaos and information
	gain.}},

	describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve
	problems faster than familiar "classical" computers, and the real-world

  abstract = {{In this first comprehensive introduction to the main ideas and techniques
	of quantum computation and information, Michael Nielsen and Isaac
	Chuang ask the question: What are the ultimate physical limits to
	computation and communication? They detail such remarkable effects
	as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography
	as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography
	and quantum error correction. A wealth of accompanying figures and
	exercises illustrate and develop the material in more depth. They
	describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve
	problems faster than familiar "classical" computers, and the real-world
	implementation of quantum computers. Their book concludes with an
	explanation of how quantum states can be used to perform remarkable
	feats of communication, and of how it is possible to protect quantum
	states against the effects of noise. }},

	systems, or qubits) that can be well isolated from the environment,
	but also initialized, measured and made to undergo controllable interactions
	to implement a universal set of quantum logic gates3. The usual set
	consists of single qubit rotations and a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate,
	which flips the state of a target qubit conditional on the control
	qubit being in the state 1. Here we report an unambiguous experimental
	demonstration and comprehensive characterization of quantum CNOT
	operation in an optical system. We produce all four entangled Bell
	states as a function of only the input qubits' logical values, for
	a single operating condition of the gate. The gate is probabilistic
	(the qubits are destroyed upon failure), but with the addition of
	linear optical quantum non-demolition measurements, it is equivalent
	to the CNOT gate required for scalable all-optical quantum computation4.}},

	The two 1D hydrogen atoms, A and B, are assumed to be initially in

	separation of R = 100 a.u. (5.29 nm). Two types of a spatial envelope

	B has been found. The ionization of atom B achieved mostly after

	driven electron by the proton of atom B and a short-range Coulomb
	repulsion of the two electrons when their wave functions significantly

	spatial envelope of the laser field, the opposite process also occurs,

  abstract = {The quantum dynamics of two distant H atoms excited by ultrashort
	and spatially shaped laser pulses is studied by the numerical solution
	of the non-Born-Oppenheimer time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation
	within a three-dimensional (3D) model, including the internuclear
	distance R and the two z coordinates of the electrons, z1 and z2.
	The two 1D hydrogen atoms, A and B, are assumed to be initially in
	their ground states with a large (but otherwise arbitrary) internuclear
	separation of R = 100 a.u. (5.29 nm). Two types of a spatial envelope
	of a laser field linearly po- larized along the z-axis are considered:
	(i) a broad Gaussian envelope, such that atom A is excited by the
	laser field predominantly, and (ii) a narrow envelope, such that
	practically only atom A is excited by the laser field. With the laser
	carrier frequency {{\o}mega} = 1.0 a.u. and the pulse duration tp
	= 5 fs, in both cases an efficient energy transfer from atom A to
	atom B has been found. The ionization of atom B achieved mostly after
	the end of the laser pulse is close to or even higher than that of
	atom A. It is shown that with a narrow spatial envelope of the laser
	field, the underlying mechanisms of the energy transfer from A to
	B and the ionization of B are the Coulomb attraction of the laser
	driven electron by the proton of atom B and a short-range Coulomb
	repulsion of the two electrons when their wave functions significantly
	overlap in the domain of atom B. In the case of a broad Gaussian
	spatial envelope of the laser field, the opposite process also occurs,
	but with smaller probability: the energy is transferred from the
	weakly excited atom B to atom A, and the ionization of atom A is
	also induced by the electron-electron repulsion in the domain of
	atom A due to a strong overlap of the electronic wave functions.},

  abstract = {{As information carriers in quantum computing1, photonic qubits have
	the advantage of undergoing negligible decoherence. However, the
	absence of any significant photon\^a€``photon interaction is problematic
	for the realization of non-trivial two-qubit gates. One solution
	is to introduce an effective nonlinearity by measurements resulting
	in probabilistic gate operations2, 3. In one-way quantum computation4,
	5, 6, 7, 8, the random quantum measurement error can be overcome
	by applying a feed-forward technique, such that the future measurement
	basis depends on earlier measurement results. This technique is crucial
	for achieving deterministic quantum computation once a cluster state
	(the highly entangled multiparticle state on which one-way quantum
	computation is based) is prepared. Here we realize a concatenated
	scheme of measurement and active feed-forward in a one-way quantum
	computing experiment. We demonstrate that, for a perfect cluster
	state and no photon loss, our quantum computation scheme would operate
	with good fidelity and that our feed-forward components function
	with very high speed and low error for detected photons. With present
	technology, the individual computational step (in our case the individual
	feed-forward cycle) can be operated in less than 150\^a€‰ns using
	electro-optical modulators. This is an important result for the future
	development of one-way quantum computers, whose large-scale implementation
	will depend on advances in the production and detection of the required
	highly entangled cluster states.}},

  abstract = {When searching for food, many organisms adopt a superdiffusive, scale-free
	movement pattern called a L\'evy walk, which is considered optimal
	when foraging for heterogeneously located resources with little prior
	knowledge of distribution patterns [Viswanathan GM, da Luz MGE, Raposo
	EP, Stanley HE (2011) The Physics of Foraging: An Introduction to
	Random Searches and Biological Encounters]. Although memory of food
	locations and higher cognition may limit the benefits of random walk
	strategies, no studies to date have fully explored search patterns
	in human foraging. Here, we show that human hunter-gatherers, the
	Hadza of northern Tanzania, perform L\'evy walks in nearly one-half
	of all foraging bouts. L\'evy walks occur when searching for a wide
	variety of foods from animal prey to underground tubers, suggesting
	that, even in the most cognitively complex forager on Earth, such
	patterns are essential to understanding elementary foraging mechanisms.
	This movement pattern may be fundamental to how humans experience
	and interact with the world across a wide range of ecological contexts,
	and it may be adaptive to food distribution patterns on the landscape,
	which previous studies suggested for organisms with more limited
	cognition. Additionally, L\'evy walks may have become common early
	in our genus when hunting and gathering arose as a major foraging
	strategy, playing an important role in the evolution of human mobility.},

	intensity, these sources rarely emit two or more photons in the same
	pulse. Numerous applications for single-photon sources have been
	proposed in the field of quantum information, but most\^aincluding
	linear-optical quantum computation12\^aalso require consecutive
	photons to have identical wave packets. For a source based on a single
	quantum emitter, the emitter must therefore be excited in a rapid
	or deterministic way, and interact little with its surrounding environment.
	Here we test the indistinguishability of photons emitted by a semiconductor
	quantum dot in a microcavity through a Hong\^aOu\^aMandel-type
	two-photon interference experiment13, 14. We find that consecutive
	photons are largely indistinguishable, with a mean wave-packet overlap
	as large as 0.81, making this source useful in a variety of experiments
	in quantum optics and quantum information.}},

  abstract = {Bell's theorem shows that local realistic theories place strong restrictions
	on observable correlations between different systems, giving rise
	to Bell's inequality which can be violated in experiments using entangled
	quantum states. Bell's theorem is based on the assumptions of realism,
	locality, and the freedom to choose between measurement settings.
	In experimental tests, ``loopholes'' arise which allow observed violations
	to still be explained by local realistic theories. Violating Bell's
	inequality while simultaneously closing all such loopholes is one
	of the most significant still open challenges in fundamental physics
	today. In this paper, we present an experiment that violates Bell's
	inequality while simultaneously closing the locality loophole and
	addressing the freedom-of-choice loophole, also closing the latter
	within a reasonable set of assumptions. We also explain that the
	locality and freedom-of-choice loopholes can be closed only within
	nondeterminism, i.e., in the context of stochastic local realism.},

	computers but a full-size realization remains challenging. However,
	intermediate quantum computational models have been proposed that
	are not universal, but can solve problems that are strongly believed
	to be classically hard. Aaronson and Arkhipov have shown that interference
	of single photons in random optical networks can solve the hard problem
	of sampling the bosonic output distribution which is directly connected
	to computing matrix permanents. Remarkably, this computation does
	not require measurement-based interactions or adaptive feed-forward
	techniques. Here we demonstrate this model of computation using high--quality
	laser--written integrated quantum networks that were designed to
	implement random unitary matrix transformations. We experimentally
	characterize the integrated devices using an in--situ reconstruction
	method and observe three-photon interference that leads to the boson-sampling
	output distribution. Our results set a benchmark for quantum computers,
	that hold the potential of outperforming conventional ones using

	was introduced by Feynman and Deutsch. It has been asked whether
	the power of this model exceeds that of classical Turing machines.
	We show here that a significant class of these quantum computations
	can be simulated classically in polynomial time. In particular we
	show that two-bit operations characterized by 4 \&times; 4 matrices
	in which the sixteen entries obey a set of five polynomial relations
	can be composed according to certain rules to yield a class of circuits
	that can be simulated classically in polynomial time. This contrasts
	with the known universality of two-bit operations and demonstrates
	that efficient quantum computation of restricted classes is reconcilable
	with the Polynomial Time Turing Hypothesis. Therefore, it is possible
	that, The techniques introduced bring the quantum computational model
	within the realm of algebraic complexity theory. In a manner consistent
	with one view of quantum physics, the wave function is simulated
	deterministically, and randomization arises only in the course of
	making measurements. The results generalize the quantum model in
	that they do not require the matrices to be unitary. In a different
	direction these techniques also yield deterministic polynomial time
	algorithms for the decision and parity problems for certain classes
	of read-twice Boolean formulae. All our results are based on the
